=Overview=

This repository provides a number of packages that support the Wubble Robot created by the Arizona Robotics Research Group. Because a number of the components of the Wubble Robot are also used by other research groups, we provide a description of the robot and of relevant software packages. The ua_robots stack contains URDF description files for the Wubble Robot and its components.
