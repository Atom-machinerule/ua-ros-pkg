#summary Instructions for students of CS 665 to set up ROS on class machines.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This page tells you how to set up your account with a functional ROS installation and UA packages. These will only work on the class machines located in GS 930 (the machine names all start with "har").

= Installation =

Easy!
  # Navigate to your home directory
{{{
cd ~
}}}
  # Download the install script 
{{{
wget http://ua-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config/install_ros_user
}}}
  # Make it executable
{{{
chmod +x install_ros_user
}}}
  # Run it!
{{{
./install_ros_user
}}}

= Building =

There are now two types of ROS packages on the machines you are using: 
  # Shared packages, which are part of the ROS distribution and come from Willow Garage. These reside in /opt/ros/installed, which means you can't change them.
  # User packages, which live in the ros directory inside your home folder (specifically, ~/ros/ua-ros-pkg).

The shared packages are already built. To build the user packages we'll be using to run some demos, execute
{{{
roscd wubble_world
rosmake
}}}

= Testing =


Here's a simple demo to run to test that you've got everything working.
