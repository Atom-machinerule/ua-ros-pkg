#summary Instructions for students of CS 665 to set up ROS on class machines.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

This page tells you how to set up your account with a functional ROS installation and UA packages. These will only work on the class machines located in GS 930 (the machine names all start with "har").

= Installation =

Easy!
  # Navigate to your home directory
{{{
cd ~
}}}
  # Download the install script 
{{{
wget http://ua-ros-pkg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config/install_ros_user
}}}
  # Make it executable
{{{
chmod +x install_ros_user
}}}
  # Run it!
{{{
./install_ros_user
}}}

= Building =

Take a quick look at [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem this ROS tutorial] to get an overview of packages and how the ROS file system is arranged. There are now two types of ROS packages on the machines you are using: 
  # Shared packages, which are part of the ROS distribution and come from Willow Garage. These have been previously installed (and compiled) in /opt/ros/installed, which means you can't change them.
  # User packages, which live in the ros directory inside your home folder (specifically, ~/ros/ua-ros-pkg).

The shared packages are already built. To build the user packages we'll be using to run some demos, execute:
{{{
rosmake wubble
}}}
This will build the whole wubble stack.

= Testing =

Here's a simple demo to run to test that you've got everything working. Try running:
{{{
roslaunch wubble_demos erratic_nav.launch
}}}

This should launch the gazebo simulator, complete with the simulated Wubble robot in a small room, as well as the rviz visualization tool. 

Also, try:
{{{
roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2_empty_world.launch
}}}
This will launch a simulated PR2 (made by Willow Garage), a sophisticated humanoid robot. You can control the robot with the keyboard by launching (in another terminal):
{{{
roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch
}}}

If all of this worked, you're ready to get started with ROS! Take a look at the [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/StartGuide ROS Quick Start Guide] if you can't wait to explore ROS further.

If something didn't work, please send email to Daniel Hewlett.
